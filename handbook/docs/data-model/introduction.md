# Introduction to Data Models

This section demonstrates four fundamental data models used in modern application development. Each model is designed to solve specific types of problems and excels in different scenarios.

## Overview

Our backend implementation showcases:

1. **Relational Model** (PostgreSQL + Sequelize)
2. **Document Model** (MongoDB + Mongoose)
3. **Graph Model** (Neo4j)
4. **Search Model** (Elasticsearch)

## Why Multiple Data Models?

Different data models are optimized for different use cases:

- **Relational databases** excel at structured data with complex relationships and ACID transactions
- **Document databases** are ideal for flexible schemas and hierarchical data
- **Graph databases** are perfect for highly connected data and relationship queries
- **Search engines** specialize in full-text search and analytics

## Polyglot Persistence

Modern applications often use multiple databases (polyglot persistence) to leverage the strengths of each model. This approach allows you to:

- Choose the right tool for each specific use case
- Optimize performance and scalability
- Maintain data consistency where needed while allowing flexibility elsewhere

## What You'll Learn

In this section, you'll learn about:

- Data modeling principles for each database type
- When to use each data model
- Query patterns and optimization techniques
- Schema design best practices
- Indexing strategies
- Real-world implementation examples

Let's dive into each data model! 🚀
